Exposing this allows anyone to reuse the key, potentially causing unauthorized API access, quota/billing abuse, and easier reconnaissance.

Even though only the header portion is shown here, the intent is clearly to embed a fallback bearer token in client code. Any real bearer/JWT token in public JS can be copied and replayed for unauthorized access until revoked, and signals insecure auth handling. https://erikvanoosbree.nl/api-config.js"

"summary": "Found a hardcoded high-entropy Google-style API key (also logged to console) and a bearer/JWT-like token embedded in client-side code, both of which can enable unauthorized use and abuse. Also noted a hardcoded analytics ID (low sensitivity) and a public API endpoint URL (informational architecture exposure)."
