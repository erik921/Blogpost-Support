Exposing this key in client-side code allows anyone to use it, potentially leading to quota exhaustion, unauthorized access, or billing charges.

Even though this is just the header part of a JWT, it indicates the application uses JWT tokens for authentication, and hardcoding any part of a token in client-side code is a security risk.

The code also exposes sensitive information through console logging. Additionally, it contains hardcoded configuration values that should be properly managed in a production environment. These issues could lead to unauthorized access to services, data breaches, or information disclosure about the application's architecture."
