The Google API key 'AIzaSyD-5_8gFp2aZ1m9K3rJ4d0eL6n7Q8w9x0y' is fully exposed and should be immediately revoked and rotated. A JWT token is also present as a fallback authentication mechanism. Additionally detected: 1 Google Analytics ID (low risk), 1 internal API endpoint exposure (medium risk), and 1 debug logging anti-pattern (low risk). Immediate action required: Revoke exposed credentials, implement server-side API proxy, and use environment variables for all secrets."
