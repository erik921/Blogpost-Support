  "summary": "5 critical/high severity findings discovered. This configuration file contains multiple hardcoded secrets including a Google API key, JWT bearer token, analytics ID, and internal endpoint URL. The API key is additionally leaked via console logging. All secrets must be removed from client-side code and managed through environment variables or server-side configuration. This file requires immediate remediation."
}
Recommended Actions:

Revoke all exposed credentials immediately via their respective provider consoles
Remove all secrets from this file and use environment variables instead
Implement server-side configuration for sensitive endpoints
Use a secrets management system (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
Remove console.log of sensitive data
Rotate API keys and tokens after this code is committed to version control
Check git history for these secrets and purge them using git-filter-branch or similar tools
